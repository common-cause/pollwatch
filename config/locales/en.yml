      about_body: PollWatchUSA is a non-partisan way to crowd source reporting problems at the polls on election day. Our goal is to facilitate solving those problems as quickly as possible so that any voter who wants to vote is able to do so easily. It is a joint project of Common Cause/NY, Reboot and Websa and won first prize at the Civic Engagement Hackathon sponsored by the Personal Democracy Forum in June, 2012.
